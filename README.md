Titanic Survival Prediction-CODSOFT Internship Task 1
The project is part of the CODSOFT Data Science internship.The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on available data such as age,gender,class,fare,etc.
Problem Statement:
Use the Titanic dataset to train a model that can predict passenger survival. This is a binary classification problem(Survived=0 or 1)
Files in the Project-
1.train.csv-Training data with survival labels
2.test.csv-Test data without labels
3.gender_submission.csv-Sample submission format
